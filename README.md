# dav

This project is intended to provide a fairly straightforward easy to install
CalDAV and CardDAV package. It makes use of the [link]http://sabre.io/
sabre/dav library for the majority of the heavy lifting.

## TODO

This project is no where close to being production ready.
* There needs to be some work done to allow more configuration.
* The web administration page needs to be finished.
* Documentation needs to be added
* A makefile to make .deb packages should likely be built as well.
